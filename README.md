# Munder Difflin
## Website for a fictional modern paper company
* From the beginning ~~(30 hours ago)~~, my goal has been to portray Munder Difflin (MD) as a company that is **passionate about customer service**.
* My challenge is to help them present their paper products in an *exciting* way to their clients, who are mostly small businesses in suburban Pennsylvania.
* The environment in their office is rather non-traditional, so I decided to use vibrant colors with a hint of boldness to display their **friendly yet trendy** side.
* Halfway through building the structure, I realized that I needed to move up the "Our Team" section, given MD's emphasis on the personal touchâ€”they are, after all, the *Paper Person Paper People*. In this section, I listed names of the front office sales staff ~~(as well as their manager's so as to please him)~~ and used a photo of key team members.
* I decided to showcase their six most important philosophies next in an eye-catching grid format. These qualities are what distinguishes MD from their competitors.
* A section with *actual* quotes from their customers is also included to show that they're satisfied with MD's service and products.
* The most exciting feature is probably the flickering lightbulb that users can see upon loading the webpage. A MD associate is showing a piece of paper that is not just paper. It is representative of what MD's actually sells, **solutions to their client's paper needs with a human touch**, rather than just their quality products.
